# Evolution Simulation

Welcome to our simulation of evolution project! We are ChatGPT and Alexander, and we are building a Python-based simulation that models the interaction between predator and prey species in a changing environment. The simulation includes randomly generated environments with varying degrees of resource availability, and we plan to implement additional features like natural selection, mutation, and genetic inheritance to allow the populations to evolve over time.

ChatGPT generated most of the code. And this file too.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the simulation, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

`python main.py`

The simulation will open in a new window and you can interact with it by following the on-screen instructions.

## Current Features

- Random generation of environment with customizable width, height, and cell size
- Different cell types with customizable color and richness

## Future Features

- Implementation of prey and predator species
- Seasonal changes in resource availability
- Evolutionary adaptation of species based on resource availability

## Dependencies

- Pygame
- Configparser
